-- POUR SOCIAL SCORE - THE SCHEMA MAP (core uplift U3, 3.4.1.47)
--
-- Data only: every field PSS saves, so a save written by a newer version
-- works in an older one and the reverse (10_CORE_UPLIFT.md 2.3).
--   * The top-level keys are LAYOUT (PSS_SavedData.lua: which table holds
--     each), every option in M.PSS_OPTIONS, and "core" below (the keys
--     PourSocialScoreDB keeps itself).
--   * Each record kind lists its fields as "name", "name=default" or
--     "name@reader" (the function that reads it, when it is not read
--     straight off the record); "old" lists the fields older versions saved
--     that this one still reads once to convert, and never writes.
--   * A field nobody lists is a newer version's: readers ignore it, nothing
--     deletes it (only RETIRED keys are ever dropped, PSS_Upgrade.lua), and
--     the export copies it. A guild rule holding one is not applied and is
--     reported (M.PSS_UnusableRules).
-- tools/check_schema.lua fails a field the code writes that is not here.

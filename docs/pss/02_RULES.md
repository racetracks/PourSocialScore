# PourSocialScore: project rules (only what PSS adds to the baseline)

**The baseline's rules are mandatory** (Dan, 2026-10-08). This file holds what is specific to PSS: the concrete values and Dan's PSS decisions. PSS overrides a baseline rule **only** where section 12 (the Overrides table) lists it; any other difference is a bug to fix. Dates are when Dan set them.

## 1. Code and style
1. Every folder indents with tabs. (Until 3.4.0.24 `PourSocialScore_EllesmereUI` used EllesmereUI's 4-space style, checked by `tools/check_rules_eui.sh`; both are gone from 3.4.0.25.)
2. Everything shared hangs on `M` via `PourSocialScore_NS` (the project's root table); use `M.ShowMsg`, `M.Trim` and the UIKit builders. Every file that uses `M` declares it as a local first (`local M = ns.M` or `addon.M`); there is no global `M` (`check_locals.lua`, 3.4.1.48).
3. Core fires `M.Events`; UIs listen and write only through core setters (`tools/check_layers.lua` enforces it).
4. The 8 StaticPopup dialogs stay as they are in the native mode.
5. **Guild member fields are read through their accessors (core uplift S2, 3.4.1.50):** `M.PSS_MemberCanon`, `M.PSS_MemberName`, `M.PSS_MemberGuildName`, `M.PSS_MemberWhenBlocked`, `M.PSS_MemberShipped`, `M.PSS_MemberPlayerKey`, and `History.CountTotal` (or `History.EnsureCounts`) for a saved counts table's total; a rule's member count from `M.PSS_GuildMemberCount`, never the saved `memberCount`. `tools/check_fields.lua` (rules check) fails the runtime fields or `memberCount` outside the accessor block.

## 2. TOCs
- Title `|cff69ccf0PourSocialScore|r <Part>`.
- Core Notes are Dan's wording: "Sometimes you dont wanna know when a man gotta slur a little". Never change Title or Notes unless asked.
- Every TOC: `## Category: PSS`, `## Group: PourSocialScore`, `## IconTexture: Interface\FriendsFrame\Battlenet-Portrait`.
- Base TOC interface `120007, 16001`; `_Mainline`; `_Camelot`. Every TOC in the repo carries one version.

## 3. Behaviour rules
- **Counting:** counters are never derived from log lines; nothing counted twice; guild rule blocks count only as guild blocks (the Chat Filters row shows "n/a"); a rule turned off disables every guild in it (`M.PSS_GuildRuleActive`).
- **A guild rule never blocks your own guild** (`M.PSS_IsOwnGuild`). Player list entries for people in your guild still block.
- **Removal** deletes all of a player's saved data. A player on a shipped guild list stays blocked with a member note.
- **W I G P C:** ticked = allowed; a new entry blocks everything; built-in filters start off.
- **What happens to anyone listed (Dan, 2026-10-08):** by default no ignore response is sent, no decline messages are shown, and their duels and trades are declined (the Options tab sets the default; Show declines Off from 3.4.0.22). Any player, guild or guild member can be an exception; the window shows each as a tick box (ticked = it happens) marked "(exception)" where it differs from the default, and a member's default is its guild's. Stored as before: `opts[key]` holds an exception, nil the default.
- **Every number the window shows comes from the core's counters**, with the same definitions as before ("this session" = since login or /reload). `check_viewquery.lua`, `check_stats.lua` and each tab's check gate it. (Until 3.4.0.24 the EllesmereUI window's numbers had to equal the native window's, gated by `check_match.lua`.)
- Every window closes on Escape. The window's looks are Blizzard's (Modern, Classic) or our flat Dark (section 11).
- No guild discovery from mouseover or nameplates in combat.
- **Forward compatible saves (core uplift U3, plan 2.3, Dan, 2026-10-08):** every field PSS saves is listed in `M.PSS_SCHEMA` (`PSS_Schema.lua`) in the PR that first saves it (`check_schema.lua` fails an unlisted one). Nothing is deleted by guesswork: only keys in `RETIRED` (`PSS_Upgrade.lua`) are dropped; a field, owner form, rule tag or built-in id this version does not know is kept and read as absent; a new layout of a whole store takes a higher `v` and an older version leaves a higher `v` untouched. A per-filter field goes in `filterID` or a table keyed by id, never a new parallel array. A rule this version cannot use is not applied, stays unchanged, is named after a version change and is exportable (`/pss export unused`). Exports carry `v` (format 2 from 3.4.1.47) and a record's unknown fields in `more`; the `PSS1` tag stays so older versions read them.

## 4. Garbage collection (changed 2026-10-07; done in 3.4.1.52, core uplift P2)
- Old PSS rule: GC on request plus a 10-minute idle cycle and a 5-minute combat wait. Gone.
- **Event-driven (Dan, 2026-10-07):** no ticker, no idle timer, no wall-clock gate. GC runs only on request (`M.PSS_RequestGC`: login, /who scan, import, window close), and only out of combat, not dead, not in an encounter and not in a dungeon, raid, battleground or arena (`IsInInstance`). A request made at a bad moment waits for `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`, `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, `ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA`, `PLAYER_ALIVE` or `PLAYER_UNGHOST`, registered only while a request waits. A running cycle stops itself at the first frame that is busy. `PSS_Perf.lua` has no `C_Timer`; `loadWhenQuiet` (Logging) waits the same way (`History.LoadWhenQuiet`). `check_gc.lua` and `check_ondemand.lua` phase 3 gate it.

## 5. Core placement (G2, confirmed 2026-10-05 15:30Z)
> "minimal functions are stored in the poursocialscore core addon. it must only service as the core framework to handle the chat filtering and a launchpad for the addon. Functions that wont run in active memory or be considered as regularly active (chat filters etc) should be in the libraries folder."

So core = the chat filtering engine plus the loader, with what filtering needs (counting, outbox, setters, events). Anything not regularly active goes in `PourSocialScore_Libraries`, including code shared by both UIs. Core functions such as `PSS_PlayerQuery` stay only if they sit on a regularly active path; flag others as move candidates with a measured cost.

## 6. Front-end separation (2026-10-05)
From 3.4.0.25 there is one front end, `PourSocialScore_GUI`; 1 and 3 to 5 still hold for it, 2 and 4's EUI state are history.
1. No application or service logic in `PourSocialScore_GUI` or `PourSocialScore_EllesmereUI`.
2. The native GUI never reads or loads a file from the EllesmereUI folder, and the reverse; a user never needs both (decision 5, Dan: "I dont want the native gui reading any files from the ellesmereui port. We need to consider them independent so the user doesnt have to load multiple addons when we can accomodte it for them and just use shard functions for calls.").
3. UI resources both need go in `PourSocialScore_Libraries`, or core if always-loaded code needs them.
4. Both read `M.PSS_OPTIONS`; the EUI folder keeps only EUI-only state in `PSS_EllesmereUIDB` (window position, last tab).
5. **Logging loads only when called** (04 section 2).

## 7. Porting to the native GUI (G7 to G10, 2026-10-05)
- **G7 (15:30Z):** every texture, font, template and API a port uses is ours or Blizzard's. Nothing from EllesmereUI or any other addon.
- **G8 (15:30Z):** ports look as close as possible to the EllesmereUI version while still looking like the Blizzard UI.
- **G9 (15:33Z):** if copying a component from our `PourSocialScore_EllesmereUI` code into `PourSocialScore_GUI` gives a lower footprint, copy it as functions into `PourSocialScore_GUI` only. A copy, not shared code. EllesmereUI's own code is never copied. (Example: `PSS_Pie.lua`, 11.4 KB.)
- **G10 (15:37Z):** `PourSocialScore_EllesmereUI` is read only during parity work; shared functions serving both UIs are performance-optimized and measured. **Exception (issue #77, option b, 16:09Z):** logic found in the EUI folder moves to Libraries and the EUI file calls it, nothing visible changing (`eui_compare.sh` identical). Done in 3.3.0-dev001.

## 8. Versions on PSS
- **Versions are `X.Y.Z.B` and the build number never resets (Dan, 2026-10-08; from 3.4.0.27):** every build that gets a test zip, a stage or a fix, merged or not, takes the next build number, and so does a full release (`3.4.0.29`); later lines count on (`3.4.1.30`). Every TOC, the history section and the zip name carry it. `versions.json` (repo root, `tools/versions.py`) records the latest release, every pre-release since it in order with its PR, and each past release with its pre-releases (references only, no text; never shipped, never mirrored); `release.yml` publishes a full release only for the version it names the latest release. `sh tools/bump_version.sh build|release|line` sets every TOC, records the version and adds the history section; `sh tools/bump_version.sh pr <number>` records the PR. `check_toc.sh` accepts only `X.Y.Z.B`; `check_rules.sh` runs `versions.py check` (in CI every entry needs its PR, a pull request's newest entry its own number) and fails a placeholder history bullet. A full release's notes are one summary of every change since the previous release, written at release time from its PRs (`CLAUDE.md`, Full releases). The baseline uses the same scheme from v7 (02 F, 09), so this is no longer an override. (3.4.0.13 to 3.4.0.26 used `X.Y.Z.B` with B per line and a plain `X.Y.Z` for a release; never used for a release.)
- **Expected builds are written down and kept in step (Dan, 2026-10-09):** the current plan gives every planned stage and release its expected build. A build added before them (a docs build or a fix) moves every later one up by one, and the PR that takes it updates every reference in the same PR: the plan's stage tables, 06, 13, `01_HANDOVER.md` (the next re-summary) and `CLAUDE.md`'s short form.
- History (before 3.4.0.13): the 3.3.0 line is the parity feature (Dan chose it on 2026-10-05). Its stages are 3.3.0-devNNN pre-releases; plain `3.3.0` only when Dan says the parity work is complete.
- Older builds used `-devN` (3.2.0-dev3). Do not copy that; three digits from 3.3.0 on.
- A fix line is the next `X.Y.Z` with the next build number (a fix for release 3.4.0.29 would be `3.4.1.30`); ask Dan if a fix line is needed.
- Until 3.4.0-dev012, **fixes to a dev build before it merged counted up with `_N` (Dan, 2026-10-07):** the first round of fixes on `3.4.0-dev002` is `3.4.0-dev002_2`, then `_3`; every TOC, the history section and the test zip name carry it. The next stage was the next devNNN (`3.4.0-dev003`). Replaced by build numbers on 2026-10-08.

## 9. Hosting paths on scratch (changed 2026-10-08)
**Scratch is the project files (Dan, 2026-10-08):** saves, plans, docs, zips and summaries all live there; there is no `/mnt/project-files`. Where a pack says "project files", read scratch.
Scratch is **`racetracks/Pour-Social-Score_Scratch`**; its rules and procedures are the scratch pack (`docs/scratch/`, rules in 05). The old `racetracks/scratch` and its paths (`PourSocialScore/test-builds/`, `pss-builds/`, `pss-projects/`, `pss-issues/`, `latest/`, `handover-packs/`) are no longer used; links already given there stay valid.
- Test zips: `releases/PourSocialScore-<version>-<YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm>.zip`; the same commit replaces the zip in `latest/` with it and updates the index rows. `sh tools/host_build.sh <scratch checkout>` does all of it from HEAD (`--no-commit` stages it so docs can join the same commit).
- Docs: the newest markdown in `docs/latest/<project>/` (current plan `docs/latest/ui uplift/`; these docs `docs/latest/pss-docs/`). Always read it first; refresh it whenever a plan or these docs change. Each docs release is zipped in the root of `docs/` (`<name>-<date>-vN.zip`); a project or feature release keeps a history folder `docs/<project>/`. Issue notes are docs too.
- Saves: `SavedVariables/<version>/`, with a line in `SavedVariables/README.md`.
- Packs: zipped in `docs/` (this pack is `pss-handover-<date>-vN`), listed in `docs/README.md`.
- Summaries: `summary/<project>-<YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm>.md`.
- Update the root `readme.md` index whenever a folder's newest file changes; always reply with links.

## 11. The new PSS window (3.4.0, Dan, 2026-10-07; details in 09)
The full rule set is the **Interface** section of `CLAUDE.md` (one section, Dan, 2026-10-08); this list is its short form.
1. The EllesmereUI port is the reference for every visual and layout choice; the old GUI is not authoritative on anything.
2. Logic in `PourSocialScore_Libraries`; drawing only in `PourSocialScore_GUI` (`PourSocialScore_UI` until 3.4.0.24). No `EUI` or `Ellesmere` names in new code (checked by `check_rules.sh`); never copy EllesmereUI's code or media.
3. Three looks with the same layout, features and feel, **listed in this order: Modern** (value 2, the default from 3.4.0-dev008_4; Blizzard's new Social window art), then the options **Classic** (0, Blizzard's classic art; named Blizzard (Default) before) and **Dark** (1, the port's style in full). Every element works in all three (`CLAUDE.md` Interface, the first rule). Dark draws the window's own popups, menus and tooltips from our kit.
4. **The accent is always the player's class colour**, in every look; no option.
5. Fonts: the look's own, a Blizzard font, or a LibSharedMedia font read only when another addon loaded it. PSS ships no library.
6. Window state and new settings live in `PSS_OptionsDB` (routed `PourSocialScoreDB` keys); no new SavedVariables.
7. **Only the main window's title carries the addon's name.** Popup and dialog titles say what they ask ("Remove Player?"), never the addon name (Dan, 2026-10-08).
8. **Core's note, party warning and reload popups stay Blizzard StaticPopups in every look** (Dan, 2026-10-08; core never loads the GUI folder for a popup). Section 1.4 still holds.
9. **EllesmereUI is the reference framework for UI elements (Dan, 2026-10-08):** when more information is needed to build a UI element, check out `EllesmereGaming/EllesmereUI` (read only) and reference it wherever possible, as a mature framework for UI porting. Ported code is rewritten to suit our rules and uses it as a reference, never copied verbatim (03 section 0).

## 10. Taint and secret values on PSS (baseline 02 J, added 2026-10-07)
PSS is a chat filter: on Retail 12.x its inputs are the values most likely to be secret (chat event arguments under chat messaging lockdown, `UnitName` and GUIDs while restricted).
1. **Every value from a chat event, unit API or popup hook goes through `M.PSS_IsSecret` (`PSS_ChatBlock.lua`) before any compare, `find`, `#`, table index or table key.** A secret author, GUID or message means the line is not filtered and not counted: return false, never error. Copy the existing shape (`if type(name) ~= "string" or M.PSS_IsSecret(name) or name == "" then return end`). **Exception (code review decision 1, Dan, 2026-10-08):** a line whose author is readable and listed but whose message is secret is still blocked and counted by the person rule; the counter and the outbox never see the message. Message-based rules (filters, words) still let a secret message through uncounted.
2. **A secret never reaches a counter, the outbox or SavedVariables.** Counting happens only on readable values (02 section 3); a skipped line is not a block.
3. **Blizzard state PSS may touch, and how:** chat filters only through `ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter`; ignore list changes only through `hooksecurefunc` on `C_FriendList` (`PSS_PlayerIgnoreList.lua`); the LFG list through `hooksecurefunc` plus `Menu.ModifyMenu`; unit menus through `Menu.ModifyMenu` (option `useUnitHacks`); `FriendsFrame` through `HookScript`, and windows may anchor to it (it is not protected); link insertion through `hooksecurefunc("ChatEdit_InsertLink")` (EUI filters), and in the new window through `hooksecurefunc(ChatFrameUtil, "InsertLink")` where Retail 12.x has it (Blizzard's renamed link insert; the old name is only a deprecated copy there; Dan, 2026-10-08); popups only as `PSS_`-prefixed `StaticPopupDialogs` entries; Escape through `UISpecialFrames`; the guild invite decline through the API only (`DeclineGuild` / `C_GuildInfo.DeclineGuild`) plus `StaticPopup_Hide("GUILD_INVITE")`, never pressing `GuildInviteFrame`'s buttons or hiding the frame (code review decision 2, Dan, 2026-10-08; done in 3.4.0.14. On Retail that window is not a StaticPopup: it closes on `GUILD_INVITE_CANCEL` or after its own 60 s, see 09 lessons); purging a newly listed person's lines from the chat frames through `RemoveMessagesByPredicate` (decision 3, Dan, 2026-10-08). Anything else that touches a Blizzard frame, table or function needs Dan's OK first and a note in the PR naming the J rules it meets.
4. Menus use `MenuUtil` / `Menu.ModifyMenu` (Retail). Never `UIDropDownMenu`. Camelot paths feature-detect the Menu API and skip the menu when it is missing (as `PSS_BlizzardUI.lua` does).
5. PSS creates no secure frames and calls no protected functions. The decline calls (`DeclineGroup`, `DeclineGuild` / `C_GuildInfo.DeclineGuild`, `CancelDuel`) run from their invite events and stay feature-detected; `C_FriendList.SendWho` runs only straight from a click or keybind (it needs a hardware event). Keep it that way; a feature that would need a secure frame or a protected call is a design question for Dan.
6. **In-game checks for any change on a chat, unit or hook path** include a run with `/console addonChatRestrictionsForced 1` and `/console addonCombatRestrictionsForced 1`: no Lua errors, no blocked-action message, and lines that cannot be read pass through unfiltered.

## 12. Overrides of the baseline (Dan, 2026-10-08)
The baseline's rules are mandatory. These are the only places PSS differs, each with Dan's OK; a breach waiting for a fix is listed with the line that fixes it. Add a row (with Dan's OK and the date) before shipping anything else that differs; a difference not listed here is a bug.

### Approved overrides
| Baseline rule | PSS instead | Dan's OK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A10 No libraries | LibSharedMedia fonts are **read** for `uiFont`, only when another addon has loaded it; PSS ships no library and never creates `LibStub` (09 decision 8) | 2026-10-07 |
| C2 No behaviour change without opt-in | The new window replaces both old windows for everyone at the cutover (D1, D2), in the Modern look by default (09 decisions 4 to 6) | 2026-10-07, Modern default 2026-10-08 |
| J4 Avoid calling Blizzard Lua that stores state | Newly listed people's lines are purged from the chat frames with `RemoveMessagesByPredicate` (10.3) | 2026-10-08 (code review decision 3) |
| J2 / J4 Never touch Blizzard state | The guild invite is declined through the API (`DeclineGuild` / `C_GuildInfo.DeclineGuild`) plus `StaticPopup_Hide("GUILD_INVITE")` (10.3) | 2026-10-08 (code review decision 2) |
| C2 No behaviour change without opt-in | From 3.4.1.35 a player ignored through Blizzard is moved into PSS (taken off Blizzard's list once confirmed, with a note) for everyone; PSS is authoritative over Blizzard's list (10_CORE_UPLIFT 2.7) | 2026-10-08 |
| C3 No OnUpdate polling | The new window's pie (`PourSocialScore_GUI/PSS_Pie.lua`) runs OnUpdate only while the mouse is over it, so the hovered slice follows the cursor; it is cleared on leave | 2026-10-08 |

Blizzard hooks approved within the J rules (post-hooks, no override): `hooksecurefunc(ChatFrameUtil, "InsertLink")` on Retail 12.x (Dan, 2026-10-08), and the rest of 10.3.

### Known breaches, with their fix
None. (The idle GC cycle in `PSS_Perf.lua`, the last one, was fixed in 3.4.1.52, core uplift P2.)

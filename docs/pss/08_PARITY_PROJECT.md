# Current project: native GUI parity with the EllesmereUI window (3.3.0, issue #78)

This is the feature that owns the 3.3.0 line. It follows baseline 10 (design, stages, one PR per stage, validation between PRs). The original analysis and plan are in `reference/plans-3.3-parity/` (live on scratch `pss-projects/pss-native-gui-port/`); the plan's step table predates the decisions, so use the table below.

## Objective
The native window (`PourSocialScore_GUI`) and the EllesmereUI window (`PourSocialScore_EllesmereUI`) offer the same features and show the same numbers, each in its own look, with the folders independent (02 sections 6 and 7). Parity is not shared UI code.

## Decisions (Dan, 2026-10-05 16:32Z)
1. **Yes:** retire `PSS_BlockStats`; native reads `History.Recent*`; the `blockStats` prune is approved. Done in dev002.
2. **Yes:** native gets the breadcrumb and back / forward navigation (Claude had recommended no).
3. **Yes:** native gets an Events tab.
4. **Port it:** the three-page detail pane (Summary / Event History / View-Edit Rule) goes into the native window, not pies on the pop-ups.
5. The front ends are independent; shared needs become shared functions in Libraries. Native-only features stay native-only for now.
Also: issue #77 decided option b (logic leaves the EUI folder for Libraries), done in dev001. dev004's layout card (side pane, 1290 wide) was never answered; built on the recommendation.

## Stage table
| Stage | Dev | What | Validation | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | dev001 | Events logic to `PSS_EventsQuery.lua`; eui_compare; split check fix | eui_compare identical; harness green | Merged #79 |
| 2 | dev002 | One counting system; BlockStats retired; check_match | Migration on 3 real saves; numbers match | Merged #80 |
| 3 | dev003 | Managed Communities row | check_managed_row; numbers match | Merged #81 |
| 4 | dev004 | Totals pane + period pie (`PSS_Pie.lua`) | check_match on the pane; in game | Merged #82 (release not published) |
| 5 | dev005 | Bugfix: window opens next to Retail 12.1's Social window (`SocialUIFrame`) as well as FriendsFrame | Harness opens Social and the Who switch; ui_compare / eui_compare identical; real saves | Merged #85 |
| 6 | **dev006** | **Type pie and type ticks**; ticks filter the period pie | Numbers match per type; in game | **Next** |
| 7 | dev007 | Three-page detail pane in the native side pane (decision 4) | Same numbers as the EUI detail pane; in game | Planned |
| 8 to 10 | dev008 to dev010 | Events tab in three PRs: (a) tab, list, Source; (b) Time with custom range, Types; (c) expired / not-stored rows, search, sorting, opening from a slice or View Events | Same lines, counts and order as the EUI Events tab after each PR | Planned |
| 11 | dev011 | Breadcrumb and back / forward (decision 2) | Behaves as in EUI | Planned |
| 12 | dev012 | Small matches: type ticks over history, Options search, click-again deselect, a tab click resetting its tab | Behaves as in EUI | Planned |
| 13 | dev013 | A rules check that fails if a UI folder gains query or counting logic; readme | Rules CI green | Planned |
| Release | **3.3.0** | Version only; history section for the whole feature | Dan confirms parity is complete | |

Dev numbers past dev006 are expected values; any split takes the next number and shifts the rest. Every stage: one PR from main, all TOCs bumped, history section, test zip on scratch, check_rules, check_eui_all, validate_all on the three real saves, ui_compare or eui_compare as relevant, measured size of anything added.

## Not in this project
- Native-only features (Player Search, Prune, right-click menus, resizable columns) in the EUI window: a later project.
- Any EUI folder change beyond dev001's logic move (G10).
- The rule deviations in 01 section 5, unless Dan says to fold them in.

## Native resources to use (G7, G8)
Pies drawn with `CreateLine` and UIKit text and tick boxes (as dev004); Blizzard templates (UICheckButtonTemplate, InputBoxTemplate, WowStyle1DropdownTemplate, UIPanelButtonTemplate, ScrollFrameTemplate); nothing from EllesmereUI's media or API. Say per stage whether it is a G9 copy (with its measured size) or a rewrite.

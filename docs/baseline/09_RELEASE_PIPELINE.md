# Tag and release pipeline: full setup

Every new project struggles with this. The whole pipeline is **two workflow files, one rules script and one rule: the version in the main TOC is the release.** Nobody tags by hand; merging a version bump to main publishes the release: a pre-release for every build, a full release for the build `versions.json` names the latest release. Every version is `X.Y.Z.B` and the build number `B` never resets (v7).

## 1. What you end up with
- Every PR runs the **Rules** check (`.github/workflows/rules.yml` running `tools/check_rules.sh`).
- Every push to main runs **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). If the main TOC's version has no release yet, it builds `<Addon>-<version>.zip`, creates the tag `v<version>` and the GitHub release with that version's history section as notes, and marks it a pre-release unless `versions.json` names that version the latest release. A full release's notes are one summary of every change since the previous release, written by Claude at release time from the PRs `versions.json` lists (section 6), and a `mirror` job can publish it on a second repo.
- Merges that don't change the version publish nothing.

## 2. Repo layout the workflows expect
```
<Addon>/                    main addon folder (its name = the TOC name = ADDON in release.yml)
  <Addon>.toc               base TOC: "## Version: X.Y.Z.B" (the version is read from here)
  <Addon>_Mainline.toc      flavour TOCs, same version
  <Addon>_Camelot.toc
  *.lua
<Addon>_<Part>/             any other addon folders (all zipped; each with its own three TOCs)
tools/check_rules.sh        the rules check (plus check_style.lua, check_layers.lua if used)
tools/bump_version.sh       sets the next version in every TOC, records it and adds the history section
tools/versions.py           the versions file's tool: next version, record, PRs between releases, check
tools/host_build.sh         builds the test zip from HEAD and hosts it (hosting pack)
versions.json               latest release, pre-releases in order with their PRs, past releases (never shipped)
.github/workflows/rules.yml
.github/workflows/release.yml
readme.txt                  copied into <Addon>/ inside the zip
history.txt                 copied into <Addon>/ inside the zip; release notes come from it
```
Every folder named `<Addon>` or `<Addon>_*` at the repo root goes into the zip, at the zip's root, so it extracts straight into `Interface/AddOns`. `.github`, `tools`, `versions.json` and anything else stay out (never put `versions.json` in an addon folder; the check fails if one does).

## 3. Step by step, from an empty repo
1. **Create the repo** (private is fine) with a default branch named `main`.
2. **Workflow permissions.** The release job writes tags and releases with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`. `release.yml` asks for `permissions: contents: write`, which is enough on a personal repo. In an organisation, or if the run fails with "Resource not accessible by integration", open **Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions** and choose **Read and write permissions**. No personal token or secret is needed.
3. **Actions enabled.** Settings > Actions > General > "Allow all actions" (or at least GitHub-authored ones: the workflows use `actions/checkout@v4`, `gh` and apt).
4. **Copy the templates** from `templates/`: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/rules.yml`, `tools/check_rules.sh`, `tools/bump_version.sh`, `tools/versions.py`, `tools/host_build.sh`, the TOC set, history.txt. Start `versions.json` at the repo root as `{ "latestRelease": null, "preReleases": [], "releases": [] }`, then `sh tools/bump_version.sh line 1.0.0 "First build"`. Copy `examples/check_style.lua`, `examples/check_layers.lua` and `examples/lua_segments.lua` into `tools/`, or delete their lines from `check_rules.sh`.
5. **Rename.** Set `ADDON:` in release.yml to the main folder name. Replace `MyAddon` in `check_rules.sh` (the file globs), in the TOCs and in check_layers' file list.
6. **Make check_rules.sh pass locally:** `sudo apt-get install -y lua5.1` then `sh tools/check_rules.sh` from the repo root.
7. **First version:** set `## Version: 0.1.0.1` in every TOC and write the first history section (or run `sh tools/bump_version.sh line 0.1.0 "First build"` once the TOCs exist):
   ```
   => 0.1.0.1 - First build

   - What changed, in plain words.
   ```
   The heading must start exactly with `=> <version> ` (arrow, space, version, space): the notes step finds the section by that prefix and stops at the next line starting with `=> `.
8. **Open the first PR.** Confirm the **Rules** check appears and passes.
9. **Branch protection (recommended).** Settings > Branches > add a rule (or ruleset) for `main`: require a pull request and require the status check `check` (the Rules job name). The check appears in the list only after it has run once, so do this after step 8.
10. **Merge.** Watch Actions > Release. When it finishes, Releases shows `v0.1.0.1` marked **Pre-release** with the zip attached, and Tags shows `v0.1.0.1`.
11. **Every later step:** `sh tools/bump_version.sh build "Title"` (every TOC to the next build, a history section on top), fill in the bullets, merge. That's the whole release process.

## 4. release.yml, explained
```yaml
# Publishes a GitHub release whenever the version in $ADDON/$ADDON.toc changes
# on main: tags v<version> and attaches $ADDON-<version>.zip (every addon folder
# $ADDON and $ADDON_*, readme.txt and history.txt inside $ADDON; no .github or
# tools). Does nothing if the release exists.
# Every version is X.Y.Z.B (B = the build number, which never resets; a
# release is a build too, 02 F). versions.json (tools/versions.py, never
# shipped) says what each one is: the latest release, or a pre-release
# recorded with its PR; a version it does not record is not published.
# A pre-release's notes are its history section. A full release's notes are
# its history section only: one summary of every change since the previous
# release, written at release time from the PRs versions.json lists between
# the two (02 F5). Job "mirror" then publishes the full release, with the
# same zip and notes, on $MIRROR_REPO (secret MIRROR_TOKEN: contents read and
# write on that repo); delete the job if there is no mirror. Pre-releases
# are not mirrored.

| Part | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `on: push: branches: [main]` | Runs after every merge; the version check makes non-bump merges a no-op |
| `workflow_dispatch` | A "Run workflow" button under Actions, to retry after fixing a failed run |
| `permissions: contents: write` | Lets `github.token` create tags and releases |
| `sed -n 's/^## Version: *//p' ... \| tr -d '\r'` | Reads the version; strips Windows line endings, which otherwise end up in the tag name |
| `gh release view "v$ver"` | Skips everything if that release already exists |
| The copy loop over `"$ADDON" "$ADDON"_*/` | Puts every addon folder at the zip root; nothing else |
| The awk block | Copies that version's history section into the release notes |
| `python3 tools/versions.py kind "$ver"` | `release` (the latest release in `versions.json`: published `--latest` and mirrored), `pre-release` (`--prerelease`), or `unknown`: the run fails and nothing is published |
| The notes block | A pre-release's notes are its history section; a release's are its history section under "Changes since <previous release>": the summary written at release time |
| `gh release create "v$ver" ... --target "$GITHUB_SHA"` | **Creates the tag and the release together** at the merged commit. Never push tags by hand |
| The last step | Turns any recorded pre-release (or an older `-` suffixed one) that someone marked as full back into a pre-release |

## 5. rules.yml and check_rules.sh
```yaml
# Rules check on every pull request and push to main: tools/check_rules.sh
name: Rules

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Lua 5.1
        run: sudo apt-get update -q && sudo apt-get install -y -q lua5.1
      - name: Check rules
        run: sh tools/check_rules.sh
```

`tools/check_rules.sh` compiles every `.lua` with `luac5.1 -p` (Lua 5.1 syntax), runs `check_style.lua` (no Lua 5.2+ features, tabs, no trailing whitespace; `--fix` repairs), checks that TOCs, XML, readme.txt and history.txt are ASCII, that every TOC carries one version shaped `X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z.B` and that history.txt starts with that version's section, and runs `check_layers.lua` (no UI calls in core logic files). It exits non-zero on any failure, which fails the PR check. Add more jobs to rules.yml (for example a harness job) as the project grows.

## 6. Versions: releases are defined by feature
A version line belongs to a feature (or an agreed set of features), not to a date or a pile of changes. Every version is `X.Y.Z.B`, and the build number `B` never resets (v7).

| Kind | Example | Published as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A stage of the feature | `1.4.0.1`, `1.4.0.2`, ... | **Pre-release** (a build); the same zip is the stage's hosted test build |
| A fix while the feature is in progress | the next build (`1.4.0.5` after `1.4.0.4`) | **Pre-release**, like any build |
| The feature complete | the next build, `1.4.0.8`, recorded as the release | **Full release**, only when the author confirms the feature is done |
| A fix after the release | `1.4.1.9`, ... then its release `1.4.1.11` | Pre-releases, then a full release |
| The next feature | `1.5.0.12` | Pre-release |

- **Versions are `X.Y.Z.B` and `B` never resets:** every build that gets a test zip, a stage or a fix, merged or not, takes the next build number and none is reused; so does the full release, and a new line counts on from there. Every TOC, the history section, the tag, the release and the zip name carry it. `sh tools/bump_version.sh build "Title"` works out the next number; the rules check fails any other shape.
- **`versions.json`** (repo root, `tools/versions.py`) is the record the pipeline trusts: `latestRelease`, `preReleases` (every build since it, in order, each `{ "version", "pr" }`) and `releases` (each past release with its `previous` release and its own `preReleases`). References only: no text. It is never in an addon folder, so never in a release zip, a test zip or the mirror. `bump_version.sh` writes it; `sh tools/bump_version.sh pr <number>` records the PR once it is open; `check_rules.sh` runs `versions.py check` (in CI every entry needs its PR and a pull request's newest entry its own number, `PR_NUMBER` in rules.yml).
- **Every build is a pre-release.** `release.yml` asks `versions.py kind`: the latest release is published as a full release (`--latest`), a recorded pre-release as a pre-release, an unrecorded version not at all; the "keep" step re-flags any recorded pre-release marked full by hand (so "Latest" always points at a real full release).
- The feature design (10_FEATURE_DESIGN_AND_DELIVERY.md) names the line before work starts.
- **Going to production:** `sh tools/bump_version.sh release "Title"` makes the next build the release: `versions.json` moves the pending pre-releases under it and names it `latestRelease`. Then Claude writes the release's history section (below); merging the PR publishes the full release and the pre-releases stay as history.
- Ask the author which line the next piece of work belongs to when it is not obvious (a new feature line or a fix line).
- One repo, one version for every folder. A second repo means a second version line and a cross-repo token.

### Full release notes and the mirror
- **Notes: one summary of every change between releases, decided at release time.** After `bump_version.sh release`, `python3 tools/versions.py prs <version>` lists every pre-release since the previous release with its PR. Claude reads each PR (title, description, diff as needed) and writes **one player-facing summary of all the changes** as the release's history section, in place of the placeholder bullet (the rules check fails while the placeholder is there). The release notes are that summary only, under "Changes since <previous release>": no per-build lists, no PR text. No API key in the pipeline. Pre-releases keep their own history section as notes.
- **Mirror (optional):** a `mirror` job runs after a **full** release and publishes the same version, zip and notes on `MIRROR_REPO` (set at the top of release.yml). Pre-releases are not mirrored, and neither is `versions.json` (only the zip and the notes go).
- **Secret** (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions on the addon repo): `MIRROR_TOKEN`, a fine-grained personal access token with **Contents: Read and write** on the mirror repo only. The built-in token cannot write to another repo. The job fails with a clear error without it.
- **The mirror repo needs at least one commit**; the tag is created on its default branch.
- **Retry:** the mirror skips anything already published, so after fixing a secret, run Actions > Release > Run workflow on main.
- Look up the changes between any two releases: `python3 tools/versions.py prs <release>` (that release's pre-releases and PRs), or with no version the pending ones.

## 7. Test zips before merge
The release only happens on merge, so each PR also gets a **test zip** built the same way from the PR's commit and hosted with a link: `sh tools/host_build.sh <hosting checkout>` does it in one step (see the hosting pack). By hand:
```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/build-<unique>/src /tmp/build-<unique>/out
git archive HEAD | tar -x -C /tmp/build-<unique>/src
cd /tmp/build-<unique>/src
for d in MyAddon MyAddon_*/; do [ -d "$d" ] && cp -r "${d%/}" ../out/; done
cp readme.txt history.txt ../out/MyAddon/
cd ../out && zip -qr ../MyAddon-1.4.0.4.zip .
```

## 8. Working from a Claude session
- `gh pr create` (GraphQL) can be blocked; create PRs through REST: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls -f title="..." -f head=<branch> -f base=main -F body=@body.md`.
- Assign the PR to the author: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n>/assignees -f "assignees[]=<owner>"`. Requesting the repo owner as reviewer on a PR they authored returns 422.
- Check CI: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<sha>/check-runs --jq '.check_runs[]|[.name,.conclusion]|@tsv'`.
- Check a release: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tags/v<version> --jq '.html_url,.prerelease'`.
- Claude cannot delete branches (403) and should not tag by hand; the author merges and deletes branches.

## 9. Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| No release after a merge | The version didn't change, or a release with that tag already exists. Bump the version |
| Release run fails "Resource not accessible by integration" | Workflow permissions are read-only. Settings > Actions > General > Read and write permissions |
| Tag name has a stray character or the run can't find the release | CRLF in the TOC; the `tr -d '\r'` must stay |
| Release notes empty | The history heading doesn't start with `=> <version> ` exactly |
| The mirror job fails | `MIRROR_TOKEN` missing or without write access, or the mirror repo has no commit. Fix it, then run the workflow by hand |
| Zip extracts into an extra folder | Zip built from the repo root instead of from inside the build folder |
| A version merged before release.yml existed has no release | Expected. Bump to a new version (or run the workflow by hand while that version is on main) |
| A broken release was published | Fix forward with the next build. To redo the same version, the author deletes the release and its tag in the GitHub UI, then runs the workflow by hand |
| Stacked PRs landed in a stale branch | PR B was based on PR A's branch and A merged first. Base every PR on main, or delete each base branch after merging so GitHub retargets the next PR. Merge the stranded work with a new PR from main |
| Changing a PR's base via the API is refused | Ask the author to change it in the GitHub UI |
| Rules fails only in CI | The runner lacks a tool the script calls; install it in rules.yml (as lua5.1 is) |
| A workflow in repo B must read private repo A | Add a fine-grained read-only token for A as a secret in B; make the job warn and pass when the secret is missing |
